348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe - Multiple Approaches
Difficulty: Medium

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:

1. A player wins if any row, column, or diagonal is completely filled with their symbols.
2. A game is over when there is a winner or all spaces are filled.

Implement the TicTacToe class:
- TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object with the size of the board n.
- int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player (1 or 2) makes a move at the position (row, col). Returns:
  - 0 if the game is ongoing after the move
  - 1 if player 1 wins after the move
  - 2 if player 2 wins after the move

"""
Tic-Tac-Toe Design demonstrates key concepts:

Core Approaches:
1. Basic Board - Store full board, check all conditions O(n)
2. Optimized Counters - Track progress with counters O(1)
3. Compact Array - Single array with +/- counting O(1)
4. With History - Support undo and move tracking
5. Multi-Game - Tournament support with statistics

Key Design Principles:
- Space-time tradeoffs (board vs counters)
- Win condition detection optimization
- State management and history tracking
- Extensibility for tournament features

Performance Characteristics:
- Basic: O(nÂ²) space, O(n) time per move
- Optimized: O(n) space, O(1) time per move
- Compact: O(n) space, O(1) time per move
- History: O(n + m) space where m is moves

Real-world Applications:
- Game development and AI
- Tournament management systems
- Educational programming examples
- Pattern recognition systems
- State machine implementations

The optimized counter approach is most commonly used
due to its O(1) move complexity and moderate space usage.
