LeetCode 714: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Stock Problems - Transaction Costs

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, 
and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, 
but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
Input: prices = [1,3,2,6,5,4], fee = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buy at prices[0] = 1
- Sell at prices[3] = 6
- Total profit = 6 - 1 - 2 = 3
Then repeat the above to gain profit of 1 more.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6

Constraints:
- 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4
- 0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4

BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL STOCK WITH TRANSACTION FEE - COST OPTIMIZATION:
=========================================================================

This problem adds transaction costs to unlimited stock trading:
- Can trade as many times as desired
- Must pay a fixed fee for each transaction (sell operation)
- Demonstrates how costs change optimal trading strategies
- Shows the balance between transaction frequency and profitability

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **FEE THRESHOLD**: Only trade when profit exceeds transaction fee
2. **EFFECTIVE COST BASIS**: After selling, new cost basis = sell_price - fee
3. **PROFIT EROSION**: Fees can make small-margin trades unprofitable
4. **FREQUENCY REDUCTION**: Higher fees favor longer holding periods
5. **BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS**: Must consider net profit, not gross profit

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **State Machine**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Two states: holding, not holding
   - Subtract fee from sell transactions
   - Most straightforward approach

2. **Greedy Simulation**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Track minimum price and sell when profitable
   - Natural trading simulation

3. **Threshold Approach**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Only execute trades above profit threshold
   - Clear decision logic

4. **Explicit DP**: O(n) time, O(n) space
   - Educational version showing DP structure

CORE STATE MACHINE:
==================
```python
held = -prices[0]    # Cost to hold stock
sold = 0             # Profit when not holding

for price in prices[1:]:
    held = max(held, sold - price)          # Keep holding or buy
    sold = max(sold, held + price - fee)    # Keep not holding or sell (pay fee)

return sold
```

**Key Modification**: Subtract fee when selling:
`sold = max(sold, held + price - fee)`

GREEDY SIMULATION:
=================
```python
total_profit = 0
min_price = prices[0]

for price in prices[1:]:
    if price < min_price:
        min_price = price
    elif price > min_price + fee:
        # Profitable after fee
        total_profit += price - min_price - fee
        min_price = price - fee  # New effective cost basis

return total_profit
```

**Effective Cost Basis**: After selling at price P with fee F:
- Gross profit from buy_price B: P - B
- Net profit: P - B - F  
- If we immediately rebuy at price P: effective cost = P - F
- This allows potential profit from future price increases

THRESHOLD DECISION LOGIC:
========================
```python
buy_price = prices[0]
profit = 0

for price in prices[1:]:
    if price > buy_price + fee:
        # Profitable to sell
        profit += price - buy_price - fee
        buy_price = price - fee  # New effective buy price
    elif price < buy_price:
        buy_price = price  # Better buy opportunity

return profit
```

FEE IMPACT ANALYSIS:
===================
Transaction fees affect trading in several ways:

1. **Minimum Profit Threshold**: 
   - Without fee: Any price increase is profitable
   - With fee: Need price increase > fee

2. **Transaction Frequency**:
   - Without fee: Can capture every small fluctuation
   - With fee: Prefer larger price movements

3. **Holding Period**:
   - Without fee: Can day-trade efficiently
   - With fee: Longer holds become more attractive

4. **Breakeven Calculation**:
   - Gross profit = sell_price - buy_price
   - Net profit = gross_profit - fee
   - Only trade if net profit > 0

MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS:
==========================

**Profit Comparison**:
- Without fee: profit = Î£ max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1])
- With fee: profit = Î£ (segment_profit - fee) for profitable segments

**Effective Cost After Trading**:
- Buy at price B, sell at price S with fee F
- Net profit: S - B - F
- Effective cost for next trade: S - F (not S)
- This maintains optimal position for future opportunities

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
| Approach        | Time | Space | Trade-offs            |
|-----------------|------|-------|-----------------------|
| State Machine   | O(n) | O(1)  | Clean, efficient      |
| Greedy Sim      | O(n) | O(1)  | Natural simulation    |
| Threshold       | O(n) | O(1)  | Clear decision logic  |
| Explicit DP     | O(n) | O(n)  | Educational value     |

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **High fees**: May make all trades unprofitable
- **Low volatility**: Small price movements insufficient to cover fees
- **Single large move**: One trade may be optimal despite unlimited transactions
- **Decreasing prices**: No profitable trades regardless of fee
- **Fee = 0**: Reduces to unlimited transactions problem

VARIANTS AND EXTENSIONS:
=======================
- **Progressive fees**: Increasing cost per transaction
- **Percentage fees**: Fee as % of transaction value
- **Buy/sell fees**: Different costs for buying vs selling
- **Volume-based fees**: Lower fees for larger transactions
- **Time-based fees**: Different fees based on holding period

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
=======================
- **Stock Trading**: Brokerage commissions and fees
- **Cryptocurrency**: Exchange trading fees
- **Forex Trading**: Spread and commission costs
- **Investment Management**: Transaction cost analysis
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Cost-aware strategy optimization

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
=======================
1. **Fee Amortization**: Spread costs over larger price movements
2. **Batch Trading**: Combine multiple small trades into larger ones
3. **Threshold Setting**: Establish minimum profit requirements
4. **Frequency Reduction**: Trade less often but more profitably
5. **Cost Monitoring**: Track fee impact on overall returns

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROBLEMS:
==============================
- **Stock II (122)**: Remove transaction fee
- **Stock with Cooldown (309)**: Add temporal constraint
- **Stock III (123)**: Add transaction count limit
- **Stock IV (188)**: Generalize transaction limits

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
========================
- **Market Impact**: Large trades affect prices
- **Slippage**: Execution price differs from quoted price
- **Bid-Ask Spread**: Additional implicit cost
- **Tax Implications**: Short-term vs long-term capital gains
- **Opportunity Cost**: Consider alternative investments

This problem elegantly demonstrates how transaction costs fundamentally
alter trading strategies, requiring a balance between transaction frequency
and profitability that mirrors real-world trading scenarios.
