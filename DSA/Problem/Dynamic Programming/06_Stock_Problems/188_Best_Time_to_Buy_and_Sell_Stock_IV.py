LeetCode 188: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Stock Problems - General K Transactions

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, 
and an integer k.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

Example 2:
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. 
Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= 100
- 1 <= prices.length <= 1000
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL STOCK IV - GENERAL K-TRANSACTION OPTIMIZATION:
========================================================================

This is the most general form of the stock trading problem:
- At most k transactions allowed (buy-sell pairs)
- Must choose k best opportunities from all possibilities
- Demonstrates the full power of dynamic programming for constrained optimization
- Unifies all previous stock problems under one framework

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **K THRESHOLD**: When k â‰¥ n/2, equivalent to unlimited transactions
2. **STATE EXPLOSION**: Need to track k different transaction states
3. **SPACE OPTIMIZATION**: Reduce from O(kÃ—n) to O(k) space
4. **ORDER DEPENDENCY**: State updates must maintain transaction sequence
5. **GENERAL FRAMEWORK**: Encompasses all other stock trading problems

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **Naive 2D DP**: O(kÃ—nÂ²) time, O(kÃ—n) space
   - For each transaction and day, try all possible buy days
   - Clear but inefficient

2. **Optimized 2D DP**: O(kÃ—n) time, O(kÃ—n) space
   - Use max_diff technique to eliminate inner loop
   - Standard DP solution

3. **Space Optimized**: O(kÃ—n) time, O(k) space
   - Use buy/sell arrays instead of full 2D table
   - Most practical solution

4. **State Machine**: O(kÃ—n) time, O(k) space
   - Model as k buy-sell state pairs
   - Most intuitive for understanding

CORE ALGORITHM (SPACE OPTIMIZED):
================================
```python
if k >= n // 2:
    return unlimited_transactions(prices)  # Greedy approach

buy = [-prices[0]] * k   # Max profit after buying in transaction i
sell = [0] * k           # Max profit after selling in transaction i

for price in prices[1:]:
    for i in range(k-1, -1, -1):  # Reverse order crucial
        sell[i] = max(sell[i], buy[i] + price)
        if i == 0:
            buy[i] = max(buy[i], -price)
        else:
            buy[i] = max(buy[i], sell[i-1] - price)

return sell[k-1]
```

STATE MACHINE FORMULATION:
=========================
```
k Transaction States:
T1: buy1 â†’ sell1
T2: buy2 â†’ sell2
...
Tk: buyk â†’ sellk

Transitions:
- buy[i] = max(buy[i], sell[i-1] - price)  // Buy in transaction i
- sell[i] = max(sell[i], buy[i] + price)   // Sell in transaction i

Dependencies:
- Transaction i depends on completion of transaction i-1
- Must update in reverse order to maintain dependencies
```

K THRESHOLD OPTIMIZATION:
========================
Critical optimization: when k â‰¥ n/2, use unlimited transactions:

**Reasoning**:
- Maximum possible transactions in n days: âŒŠn/2âŒ‹
- If k â‰¥ n/2, the constraint is not binding
- Use O(n) greedy algorithm instead of O(kÃ—n) DP

```python
if k >= len(prices) // 2:
    # Unlimited transactions (greedy)
    return sum(max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1]) for i in range(1, len(prices)))
```

DP RECURRENCE RELATIONS:
=======================
General k-transaction DP:
```
dp[i][j] = max profit using at most i transactions by day j

Base cases:
- dp[0][j] = 0  (no transactions allowed)
- dp[i][0] = 0  (only one day)

Recurrence:
dp[i][j] = max(
    dp[i][j-1],                              // Don't trade on day j
    max(prices[j] - prices[m] + dp[i-1][m])  // Sell on day j, bought on day m
)

Optimization with max_diff:
max_diff = max(dp[i-1][m] - prices[m]) for m < j

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + max_diff)
```

SPACE OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE:
============================
Transform 2D DP to 1D:
```
Original: dp[i][j] and dp[i-1][j]
Optimized: buy[i] and sell[i] arrays

Mapping:
- buy[i] â‰ˆ max profit state after buying in transaction i
- sell[i] â‰ˆ max profit state after selling in transaction i

Update order crucial:
- Process transactions i from k-1 down to 0
- Ensures sell[i-1] is from previous iteration when updating buy[i]
```

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
| Approach         | Time    | Space | Best Use Case        |
|------------------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Naive 2D DP      | O(kÃ—nÂ²) | O(kÃ—n)| Educational          |
| Optimized 2D DP  | O(kÃ—n)  | O(kÃ—n)| Standard solution    |
| Space Optimized  | O(kÃ—n)  | O(k)  | Memory constrained   |
| State Machine    | O(kÃ—n)  | O(k)  | Intuitive reasoning  |

SPECIAL CASES:
=============
- **k = 0**: No transactions allowed â†’ profit = 0
- **k = 1**: Single transaction â†’ Stock Problem I
- **k = 2**: Two transactions â†’ Stock Problem III  
- **k â‰¥ n/2**: Unlimited transactions â†’ Stock Problem II
- **n â‰¤ 1**: Insufficient days â†’ profit = 0

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **Empty prices**: Return 0
- **Single day**: Return 0 (can't trade)
- **Decreasing prices**: Return 0 (no profit possible)
- **Increasing prices**: May not need all k transactions
- **k > n/2**: Use unlimited transaction algorithm

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROBLEMS:
==============================
This problem is the master template:
- **Stock I (121)**: k = 1
- **Stock II (122)**: k = âˆž (unlimited)
- **Stock III (123)**: k = 2
- **Stock with Cooldown (309)**: Add state for cooldown
- **Stock with Fee (714)**: Subtract fee from each transaction

EXTENSIONS AND VARIANTS:
=======================
- **Exactly k transactions**: Modify DP to require all k transactions
- **Transaction fees**: Subtract fee from each sell operation
- **Minimum gap**: Require minimum days between transactions
- **Volume limits**: Limited shares per transaction
- **Multi-stock**: Extend to multiple stocks

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
========================
- **Transaction Costs**: Real trading has brokerage fees
- **Market Impact**: Large orders affect stock prices
- **Liquidity**: May not be able to buy/sell desired quantities
- **Tax Implications**: Short-term vs long-term capital gains
- **Risk Management**: Diversification vs concentration

MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES:
========================
- **Monotonicity**: profit(k) â‰¤ profit(k+1) for same prices
- **Convergence**: profit(k) stabilizes at k = âŒŠn/2âŒ‹
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal k-transaction solution contains optimal (k-1)-transaction subsolution
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same states computed multiple times

ALGORITHM DESIGN INSIGHTS:
==========================
This problem showcases several key algorithmic techniques:
1. **Threshold Optimization**: Switch algorithms based on parameter size
2. **Space-Time Tradeoffs**: 2Dâ†’1D space reduction
3. **State Compression**: Represent complex states efficiently
4. **Order Dependencies**: Careful state update sequencing
5. **Generalâ†’Specific**: Unify multiple related problems

This represents the pinnacle of stock trading optimization problems,
demonstrating how dynamic programming can solve complex constrained
optimization problems efficiently.
