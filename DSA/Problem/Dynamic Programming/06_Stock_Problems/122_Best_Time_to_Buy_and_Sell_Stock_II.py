LeetCode 122: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Stock Problems - Multiple Transactions

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. 
However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

Example 3:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL STOCK II - UNLIMITED TRANSACTIONS:
============================================================

This problem extends the single transaction case to unlimited transactions:
- Can buy and sell as many times as desired
- Must sell before buying again (can't hold multiple shares)
- Can buy and sell on the same day
- Demonstrates the power of greedy algorithms in stock trading

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **GREEDY OPTIMAL**: Capturing every price increase is optimal
2. **UNLIMITED TRANSACTIONS**: No constraint on number of trades
3. **PEAK-VALLEY PATTERN**: Buy at local minima, sell at local maxima
4. **SAME-DAY TRADING**: Can buy and sell on the same day
5. **ADDITIVE PROFIT**: Total profit = sum of all profitable segments

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **Greedy Approach**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Capture every price increase
   - Most intuitive and efficient

2. **State Machine**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Model holding/not holding states
   - Foundation for constrained versions

3. **Peak-Valley**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Find local minima and maxima
   - Natural trading strategy

4. **Explicit DP**: O(n) time, O(n) space
   - Educational version showing DP structure

CORE GREEDY ALGORITHM:
=====================
```python
total_profit = 0

for i in range(1, len(prices)):
    if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
        total_profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]

return total_profit
```

**Why Greedy Works:**
- Every profitable segment contributes to optimal solution
- No benefit in skipping profitable opportunities
- Mathematical proof: any optimal solution can be decomposed into profitable segments

PEAK-VALLEY ALGORITHM:
=====================
```python
total_profit = 0
i = 0

while i < len(prices) - 1:
    # Find valley (local minimum)
    while i < len(prices) - 1 and prices[i + 1] <= prices[i]:
        i += 1
    valley = prices[i]
    
    # Find peak (local maximum)
    while i < len(prices) - 1 and prices[i + 1] >= prices[i]:
        i += 1
    peak = prices[i]
    
    total_profit += peak - valley

return total_profit
```

STATE MACHINE FORMULATION:
=========================
```
States:
- HELD: Currently holding stock
- SOLD: Not holding stock

Transitions:
- HELD â†’ HELD: Continue holding
- HELD â†’ SOLD: Sell stock (profit = price)
- SOLD â†’ HELD: Buy stock (cost = -price)
- SOLD â†’ SOLD: Continue not holding

Update equations:
held = max(held, sold - price)    # Keep holding or buy
sold = max(sold, held + price)    # Keep not holding or sell
```

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS:
=====================
**Theorem**: The greedy algorithm is optimal.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Any optimal solution can be viewed as a sequence of buy-sell pairs
2. Each pair contributes (sell_price - buy_price) to total profit
3. Between any buy day i and sell day j (i < j), the greedy algorithm captures:
   sum(max(0, prices[k] - prices[k-1])) for k in [i+1, j]
4. This sum equals prices[j] - prices[i] when prices[j] > prices[i]
5. Therefore, greedy captures all profitable opportunities optimally

COMPLEXITY COMPARISON:
=====================
| Approach        | Time | Space | Intuition            |
|-----------------|------|-------|----------------------|
| Greedy          | O(n) | O(1)  | Capture every gain   |
| State Machine   | O(n) | O(1)  | DP state transitions |
| Peak-Valley     | O(n) | O(1)  | Natural trading      |
| Explicit DP     | O(n) | O(n)  | Educational clarity  |

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **Empty array**: Return 0
- **Single element**: Return 0 (can't trade)
- **Decreasing prices**: Return 0 (no profit possible)
- **Increasing prices**: Profit = last - first
- **Constant prices**: Return 0 (no profitable trades)

EXTENSIONS AND VARIANTS:
=======================
- **Transaction Fee**: Subtract fee from each sale
- **Cooldown**: Must wait one day after selling
- **Hold Limit**: Maximum days to hold stock
- **Volume Constraints**: Limited shares available

APPLICATIONS:
============
- **Day Trading**: Unlimited transaction strategies
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Trend-following algorithms
- **Market Making**: Continuous buy-sell operations
- **Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences
- **Resource Trading**: Commodity trading strategies

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROBLEMS:
==============================
- **Stock I (121)**: Single transaction version
- **Stock III (123)**: At most 2 transactions
- **Stock IV (188)**: At most k transactions
- **Stock with Cooldown (309)**: Adds cooldown constraint
- **Stock with Fee (714)**: Adds transaction cost

GREEDY VS DP PERSPECTIVE:
========================
This problem showcases when greedy algorithms are optimal:

**Greedy Properties Met**:
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: Local optimal choices lead to global optimum
2. **Optimal Substructure**: Problem breaks down optimally
3. **No Dependencies**: Each decision is independent of future unknown prices

**When Greedy Fails** (other stock problems):
- Limited transactions (must choose which opportunities to take)
- Cooldown periods (decisions affect future availability)
- Transaction costs (may make some trades unprofitable)

PRACTICAL TRADING INSIGHTS:
===========================
- **Trend Following**: Always stay with the trend
- **No Market Timing**: Don't try to predict perfect peaks/valleys
- **Transaction Costs**: In reality, fees make frequent trading expensive
- **Slippage**: Real markets have bid-ask spreads
- **Risk Management**: Unlimited transactions increase exposure

This problem elegantly demonstrates how unlimited resources (transactions)
can simplify an optimization problem to a simple greedy strategy.
