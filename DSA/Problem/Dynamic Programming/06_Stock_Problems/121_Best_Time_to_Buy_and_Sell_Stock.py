LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Stock Problems - Foundation

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are completed, so the max profit = 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL STOCK - FOUNDATION OF STOCK PROBLEMS:
===============================================================

This is the fundamental stock trading problem that introduces key concepts:
- Single transaction constraint (buy once, sell once)
- Must buy before selling
- Maximize profit or return 0 if no profit possible
- Foundation for all other stock trading problems

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **SINGLE PASS SOLUTION**: Optimal O(n) solution with one pass
2. **MIN PRICE TRACKING**: Keep track of minimum price seen so far
3. **GREEDY STRATEGY**: Always consider selling at current price
4. **STATE MACHINE**: Can model as buy/sell state transitions
5. **KADANE CONNECTION**: Similar structure to maximum subarray

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **Brute Force**: O(nÂ²) time, O(1) space
   - Try all buy-sell pairs
   - Simple but inefficient

2. **Min Price Tracking**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Track minimum price and maximum profit
   - Most intuitive optimal solution

3. **Kadane's Variant**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Transform to maximum subarray problem
   - Find maximum sum of price differences

4. **State Machine DP**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Model holding/not holding stock as states
   - Foundation for more complex stock problems

CORE ALGORITHM (MIN PRICE TRACKING):
===================================
```python
min_price = prices[0]
max_profit = 0

for price in prices:
    min_price = min(min_price, price)        # Update minimum
    profit = price - min_price               # Profit if sell today
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)     # Update maximum

return max_profit
```

STATE MACHINE FORMULATION:
=========================
Two states: HOLDING stock, NOT HOLDING stock

```python
held = -prices[0]    # Cost to buy on day 0
sold = 0             # No stock initially

for price in prices[1:]:
    held = max(held, -price)           # Keep holding or buy
    sold = max(sold, held + price)     # Keep not holding or sell

return sold  # Want to end without holding stock
```

KADANE'S ALGORITHM CONNECTION:
=============================
Transform to maximum subarray of daily price changes:
```python
max_ending_here = 0
max_so_far = 0

for i in range(1, len(prices)):
    daily_change = prices[i] - prices[i-1]
    max_ending_here = max(daily_change, max_ending_here + daily_change)
    max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

return max_so_far
```

MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES:
========================
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal subsolutions
- **Greedy Choice**: Selling at any price after minimum is valid consideration
- **Monotonicity**: Maximum profit is non-decreasing as we process more days
- **Single Transaction**: Constraint simplifies to tracking single minimum

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
| Approach        | Time | Space | Notes                    |
|-----------------|------|-------|--------------------------|
| Brute Force     | O(nÂ²)| O(1)  | Try all pairs           |
| Min Tracking    | O(n) | O(1)  | Optimal simple solution |
| Kadane Variant  | O(n) | O(1)  | Transform to max subarray|
| State Machine   | O(n) | O(1)  | DP foundation           |
| Explicit DP     | O(n) | O(n)  | Educational version     |

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **Empty array**: Return 0
- **Single element**: Return 0 (can't buy and sell)
- **Decreasing prices**: Return 0 (no profit possible)
- **Increasing prices**: Profit = last - first
- **All same prices**: Return 0

VARIANTS AND EXTENSIONS:
=======================
- **Transaction Fee**: Subtract fee from each transaction
- **Cooldown**: Must wait one day after selling before buying
- **Multiple Transactions**: Allow multiple buy-sell cycles
- **Limited Transactions**: At most k transactions allowed

APPLICATIONS:
============
- **Financial Trading**: Single stock transaction optimization
- **Investment Planning**: When to buy and sell assets
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimal timing for resource acquisition/disposal
- **Market Analysis**: Identifying optimal trading opportunities

RELATED PROBLEMS:
================
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (122)**: Multiple transactions
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III (123)**: At most 2 transactions
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV (188)**: At most k transactions
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell with Cooldown (309)**: Cooldown constraint
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell with Fee (714)**: Transaction fee

STATE MACHINE FOUNDATION:
========================
This problem introduces the state machine concept used in all stock problems:

```
States:
- HOLD: Currently holding stock
- SOLD: Not holding stock

Transitions:
- HOLD â†’ HOLD: Continue holding
- HOLD â†’ SOLD: Sell stock
- SOLD â†’ HOLD: Buy stock (only if haven't bought before)
- SOLD â†’ SOLD: Continue not holding
```

OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS:
=====================
1. **Single Pass**: One pass through array is sufficient
2. **Constant Space**: No need to store intermediate results
3. **Early Termination**: Can stop if remaining days can't improve profit
4. **Greedy Valid**: Local optimal choices lead to global optimum

This foundational problem establishes the patterns and techniques used
throughout the entire family of stock trading problems.
