LeetCode 808: Soup Servings
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Probability DP - Expected Value with Approximation

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially, we have n ml of each type of soup.

There are four kinds of operations:
1. Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B
2. Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B
3. Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B
4. Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B

Each operation has equal probability (25% each).

When one or both types of soup are served, the game ends. Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.

Note that we do not have an operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.

Example 1:
Input: n = 50
Output: 0.625
Explanation: 
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first.
For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
For the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A being empty first plus half the probability of A and B being empty at the same time, is 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.125 + 0.0 = 0.625.

Example 2:
Input: n = 100
Output: 0.71875

Constraints:
- 0 <= n <= 10^9

SOUP SERVINGS - PROBABILITY WITH ASYMMETRIC BIAS AND APPROXIMATION:
===================================================================

This problem demonstrates probability DP with systematic bias:
- Asymmetric operations that favor one outcome over another
- Large state space requiring scaling and approximation techniques
- Convergence analysis for asymptotic behavior
- Expected value calculation with absorbing states

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **OPERATION BIAS**: Soup A consumed faster on average (62.5 vs 37.5 ml per operation)
2. **ASYMPTOTIC CONVERGENCE**: For large n, probability approaches 1 due to systematic bias
3. **SCALING OPTIMIZATION**: Reduce state space by greatest common divisor (25)
4. **APPROXIMATION THRESHOLD**: Use empirical threshold to avoid expensive computation
5. **TIE-BREAKING**: Simultaneous emptying gets 50% probability weight

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **Recursive**: O(4^(n/25)) time, O(n/25) space
   - Direct probability tree exploration
   - Exponential complexity without memoization

2. **Memoization**: O((n/25)Â²) time, O((n/25)Â²) space
   - Top-down DP with state caching
   - Quadratic in scaled problem size

3. **Approximation**: O(1) time, O(1) space
   - Use threshold-based approximation for large n
   - Leverages convergence analysis

4. **Scaled DP**: O((n/25)Â²) time, O((n/25)Â²) space
   - Bottom-up DP with optimized state space
   - Most practical approach

CORE SCALED DP ALGORITHM:
========================
```python
def soupServings(n):
    if n >= 4800:  # Empirical convergence threshold
        return 1.0
    
    n = (n + 24) // 25  # Scale by GCD of operations
    operations = [(4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (1,3)]  # Scaled operations
    
    memo = {}
    
    def prob(a, b):
        if a <= 0 and b <= 0: return 0.5  # Tie
        if a <= 0: return 1.0             # A wins
        if b <= 0: return 0.0             # B wins
        
        if (a,b) in memo: return memo[(a,b)]
        
        total = sum(prob(a-da, b-db) for da,db in operations)
        memo[(a,b)] = total / 4.0
        return memo[(a,b)]
    
    return prob(n, n)
```

BIAS ANALYSIS:
=============
**Operations**: (100,0), (75,25), (50,50), (25,75)
**Average Consumption**: A = 62.5 ml, B = 37.5 ml per operation
**Systematic Bias**: 25 ml per operation favoring A depletion

**Convergence**: As n â†’ âˆž, P(A empty first) â†’ 1

SCALING OPTIMIZATION:
====================
**Observation**: All operations are multiples of 25
**Scaling Factor**: Divide all quantities by 25
**State Reduction**: From O(nÂ²) to O((n/25)Â²) states
**Precision**: No loss due to integer scaling

APPROXIMATION TECHNIQUE:
=======================
**Empirical Threshold**: n â‰¥ 4800 implies P â‰ˆ 1.0
**Convergence Rate**: Exponential approach to asymptotic value
**Error Bound**: Negligible for practical purposes
**Computational Savings**: Constant time for large inputs

ABSORBING STATE ANALYSIS:
========================
**Terminal States**: 
- (a â‰¤ 0, b â‰¤ 0): Both empty â†’ probability 0.5
- (a â‰¤ 0, b > 0): A empty first â†’ probability 1.0  
- (a > 0, b â‰¤ 0): B empty first â†’ probability 0.0

**Transition Probabilities**: Uniform 1/4 for each operation

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
**Unscaled**: O(nÂ²) states, prohibitive for large n
**Scaled**: O((n/25)Â²) = O(nÂ²/625) states, manageable
**Approximation**: O(1) for n â‰¥ threshold

**Memory**: Same as time complexity for memoization

CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES:
======================
**Bias Direction**: Systematic toward A depletion
**Rate**: Exponential convergence to P = 1
**Threshold**: Empirically n â‰¥ 4800 gives P > 0.99999
**Stability**: Robust across different scaling approaches

APPLICATIONS:
============
- **Resource Competition**: Modeling asymmetric resource depletion
- **Reliability Engineering**: Component failure analysis with bias
- **Game Design**: Balancing mechanics with inherent advantages
- **Queuing Systems**: Service completion with preferential processing
- **Financial Modeling**: Default probability with systematic risk

RELATED PROBLEMS:
================
- **Gambler's Ruin**: Biased random walk with absorbing barriers
- **Asymmetric Random Walk**: General class of biased stochastic processes
- **Competing Processes**: Multiple processes with different rates
- **Threshold Models**: Problems requiring approximation for large parameters

VARIANTS:
========
- **Different Operations**: Modify consumption patterns
- **Weighted Probabilities**: Non-uniform operation selection
- **Multiple Resources**: Extend to 3+ competing resources
- **Dynamic Operations**: Operations that change over time

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **n = 0**: Both empty initially â†’ probability 0.5
- **Single Operation**: Would create deterministic bias
- **Balanced Operations**: Equal average consumption â†’ probability 0.5
- **Extreme Bias**: One resource always consumed â†’ probability approaches 1

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
=======================
**Scaling**: Reduce state space by GCD
**Approximation**: Empirical thresholds for convergence
**Memoization**: Cache intermediate results
**Early Termination**: Stop when convergence achieved

This problem elegantly demonstrates how systematic bias
in stochastic processes leads to predictable asymptotic
behavior, showcasing practical approximation techniques
for managing computational complexity in probability DP.
