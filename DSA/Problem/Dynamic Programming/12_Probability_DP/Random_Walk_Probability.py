Random Walk Probability Problems
Difficulty: Medium to Hard
Category: Probability DP - Stochastic Processes

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
Collection of random walk probability problems:

1. Simple Random Walk: Probability of reaching target from origin
2. Random Walk with Barriers: Absorbing/reflecting boundaries
3. Biased Random Walk: Non-uniform step probabilities
4. 2D Random Walk: Probability calculations on grid
5. First Passage Time: Expected time to reach target

These problems demonstrate fundamental concepts in:
- Markov chains and transition probabilities
- Absorbing and reflecting boundary conditions
- Expected value and variance calculations
- Convergence and limiting behavior

Example Problems:
- Probability of reaching +n before -m starting from 0
- Expected number of steps to reach boundary
- Probability distribution after k steps
- Long-term behavior and stationary distributions

RANDOM WALK PROBABILITY - STOCHASTIC PROCESS FOUNDATIONS:
=========================================================

This collection demonstrates fundamental stochastic processes:
- Markov chains with discrete state spaces
- Boundary value problems for difference equations
- Expected hitting times and absorption probabilities
- Multi-dimensional random processes
- Various boundary conditions (absorbing, reflecting)

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **MARKOV PROPERTY**: Future evolution depends only on current state
2. **BOUNDARY CONDITIONS**: Absorbing vs reflecting barriers dramatically change behavior
3. **BIAS EFFECTS**: Even small bias can dramatically alter long-term behavior
4. **DIMENSIONAL SCALING**: Higher dimensions are typically transient
5. **CENTRAL LIMIT BEHAVIOR**: Proper scaling leads to Brownian motion

FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS:
====================

1. **Simple Random Walk**: Equal probability left/right steps
   - P(reach target before barrier) = classical gambler's ruin formula
   - Symmetric case: probability proportional to distance ratios

2. **Biased Random Walk**: p â‰  0.5 for rightward movement
   - Drift parameter: Î¼ = 2p - 1
   - Exponential dependence on bias strength

3. **Multi-dimensional Walk**: Extension to higher dimensions
   - Recurrent in 1D and 2D, transient in 3D+
   - Scaling behavior: displacement ~ âˆšn for unbiased walks

4. **Boundary Conditions**: Different types of barriers
   - Absorbing: walker stops upon hitting
   - Reflecting: walker bounces back
   - Periodic: walker wraps around

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS:
========================
**Difference Equations**: Random walks satisfy linear difference equations
**Generating Functions**: Powerful tool for exact calculations
**Martingale Theory**: Unbiased walks have martingale structure
**Optional Stopping**: Expected values at stopping times

ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES:
======================

1. **Iterative Methods**: Gauss-Seidel for boundary value problems
2. **Matrix Methods**: Linear algebra for finite state spaces
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Optimal stopping and control problems
4. **Simulation**: Monte Carlo for complex scenarios

CORE ALGORITHMS:

```python
# Simple random walk absorption probability
def absorption_probability(start, target, barriers):
    # Solve: P(x) = 0.5 * (P(x-1) + P(x+1))
    # With boundary conditions: P(target) = 1, P(barriers) = 0
    
# Expected hitting time
def expected_hitting_time(start, targets):
    # Solve: E(x) = 1 + 0.5 * (E(x-1) + E(x+1))
    # With boundary conditions: E(targets) = 0
```

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
**Time**: O(n) for 1D problems, O(n^d) for d-dimensional
**Space**: O(n) for iterative methods, O(n^2) for matrix methods
**Convergence**: Geometric for most boundary value problems

APPLICATIONS:
============
- **Finance**: Asset price modeling, option pricing, risk management
- **Physics**: Diffusion, Brownian motion, statistical mechanics
- **Biology**: Population dynamics, genetic drift, foraging behavior
- **Computer Science**: Load balancing, cache performance, algorithm analysis
- **Engineering**: Signal processing, reliability analysis, queueing systems

ADVANCED TOPICS:
===============
- **LÃ©vy Flights**: Heavy-tailed step distributions
- **Persistent Walks**: Memory and correlation effects
- **Graph Walks**: Random walks on complex networks
- **Continuous Limits**: Connection to stochastic differential equations

This framework provides the foundation for understanding
more complex stochastic processes and their applications
across diverse fields requiring probabilistic modeling.
