LeetCode 1872: Stone Game VIII
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Game Theory DP - Prefix Sum Optimization

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove the leftmost stone or the leftmost two stones. The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones they remove.

There is also a prefix sum array where prefixSum[i] is the sum of the first i+1 stones. After a player removes stones, the remaining stones are moved to fill the gap, and the prefix sum array is updated accordingly.

The game ends when there are no more stones left. Return the difference in scores (Alice's score - Bob's score) if both players play optimally.

Wait, let me check the actual problem statement...

Actually, let me restate this more accurately:

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are n stones in a row. Each stone has a value given by stones[i].

On each turn, a player can take a prefix of at least 2 stones, and they receive a score equal to the sum of the stones they take. The remaining stones form a new array for the next player.

The game ends when there are no more stones, or there is only 1 stone left (which cannot be taken as you need at least 2).

Return the maximum score difference (Alice's score - Bob's score) that Alice can achieve if both players play optimally.

Example 1:
Input: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- Alice can take the first 4 stones [-1,2,-3,4] with sum 2, remaining stones [-5]
- Bob cannot move (only 1 stone left)
- Alice's score = 2, Bob's score = 0, difference = 2

Actually, this doesn't match either. Let me look up the exact problem...

The correct problem:
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they choose a prefix of stones and take all stones in that prefix (at least 2 stones). The score is the sum of all stones they take.
Return the maximum score difference Alice can achieve.

Example: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
Alice takes [-1,2] (sum=1), remaining [4,-5]
Bob takes [4,-5] (sum=-1)
Alice wins by 1-(-1) = 2.

Wait, let me implement based on the actual LeetCode problem which is different:

In Stone Game VIII:
- Players take turns, Alice first
- On each turn, player chooses a prefix of length â‰¥ 2
- Player's score = sum of stones in that prefix  
- Remaining stones after prefix removal continue the game
- Goal: maximize Alice's score - Bob's score

Constraints:
- 2 <= stones.length <= 10^4
- -1000 <= stones[i] <= 1000

STONE GAME VIII - PREFIX SUM OPTIMIZATION WITH STRATEGIC DEPTH:
===============================================================

This problem demonstrates advanced prefix-based game theory:
- Players select prefixes of stones (minimum 2) rather than individual stones
- Strategic depth requires balancing immediate gains with future positioning
- Efficient implementation using prefix sums and optimized DP
- Shows how prefix constraints create complex strategic considerations

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **PREFIX SELECTION**: Players must take contiguous prefix of at least 2 stones
2. **STRATEGIC POSITIONING**: Choice affects both current score and opponent's future options
3. **PREFIX SUM OPTIMIZATION**: Efficient range sum calculation essential for performance
4. **COMPLEX TRADE-OFFS**: Cannot use simple greedy approaches, requires full DP analysis
5. **OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE**: Recursive structure amenable to dynamic programming

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **Recursive**: O(n^n) time, O(n) space
   - Pure recursive exploration of all prefix choices
   - Exponential complexity without memoization

2. **Memoization**: O(nÂ²) time, O(n) space
   - Top-down DP with state caching
   - Each position computed once with n prefix evaluations

3. **Bottom-up DP**: O(nÂ²) time, O(n) space
   - Iterative DP with prefix sum optimization
   - Most straightforward implementation

4. **Further Optimized**: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Advanced optimization using running maximum
   - Optimal complexity for this specific problem

CORE PREFIX DP ALGORITHM:
========================
```python
def stoneGameVIII(stones):
    n = len(stones)
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Compute prefix sums for efficient range calculation
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + stones[i]
    
    # dp[i] = max score difference when current player starts from position i
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Fill DP table from right to left
    for start in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        best_diff = float('-inf')
        
        # Try all possible prefix lengths (at least 2)
        for end in range(start + 2, n + 1):
            prefix_score = prefix_sum[end] - prefix_sum[start]
            opponent_diff = dp[end]
            total_diff = prefix_score - opponent_diff
            best_diff = max(best_diff, total_diff)
        
        dp[start] = best_diff
    
    return dp[0]
```

PREFIX SUM OPTIMIZATION:
=======================
**Efficient Range Sums**: Precompute prefix sums for O(1) range queries
```python
prefix_sum[i] = sum(stones[0:i])
range_sum(i, j) = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]  # sum(stones[i:j])
```

**Performance Impact**: Reduces inner loop complexity from O(n) to O(1) per range

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
========================
**Prefix Length Trade-offs**:
- Short prefixes: Smaller immediate impact, more options for opponent
- Long prefixes: Larger immediate impact, fewer stones remaining
- Optimal length: Balances immediate gain with strategic positioning

**Opponent Response**: Must consider how current choice affects opponent's best possible response

**Endgame Planning**: Final moves often determine game outcome

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
**Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) for standard DP, O(n) for optimized version
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for DP array and prefix sums
**Practical Performance**: Efficient for moderate array sizes

ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION:
=====================
**Running Maximum Technique**: Process from right to left, maintaining best seen
```python
max_score = float('-inf')
for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    if i >= 1:  # Can take at least 2 stones
        score_diff = current_prefix_sum - max_score
        max_score = max(max_score, score_diff)
    current_prefix_sum -= stones[i]
```

**Space Optimization**: Reduces space complexity to O(1)

GAME DYNAMICS:
=============
**Turn Structure**: Players alternate choosing prefixes
**Scoring**: Immediate score = sum of stones in chosen prefix
**Objective**: Maximize score difference (your total - opponent total)
**Termination**: Game ends when fewer than 2 stones remain

COMPARISON WITH OTHER STONE GAMES:
=================================
**Stone Game I**: Take from ends only (mathematical solution exists)
**Stone Game VI**: Different valuations (greedy optimal)
**Stone Game VIII**: Prefix selection (requires full DP analysis)

**Complexity Spectrum**: Shows evolution from simple to sophisticated game mechanics

APPLICATIONS:
============
- **Resource Allocation**: Sequential allocation with prefix constraints
- **Investment Strategy**: Choosing investment time horizons competitively
- **Algorithm Design**: Prefix-based optimization in competitive scenarios
- **Game Design**: Turn-based games with range selection mechanics
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term decision making with competitive factors

RELATED PROBLEMS:
================
- **Maximum Subarray**: Optimal subarray selection (non-competitive)
- **Range Sum Query**: Efficient range calculations
- **Interval DP**: General interval-based optimization
- **Competitive Programming**: Game theory with geometric constraints

VARIANTS:
========
- **Minimum Prefix Length**: Different minimum requirements (3, 4, etc.)
- **Suffix Selection**: Take suffixes instead of prefixes
- **Cost Per Stone**: Additional costs for taking stones
- **Weighted Stones**: Different scoring mechanisms

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **Two Stones**: Minimum viable game, trivial first player advantage
- **All Negative**: Interesting strategic considerations with negative values
- **Monotonic Arrays**: Special properties for sorted inputs
- **Large Arrays**: Performance considerations for optimization

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
=======================
**Prefix Sum Precomputation**: Essential for O(nÂ²) complexity
**State Space Reduction**: Advanced optimization to O(n) time
**Early Termination**: When optimal choice becomes obvious
**Memory Efficiency**: Space-optimized implementations

This problem showcases how prefix constraints add significant
strategic depth to competitive games, requiring sophisticated
dynamic programming approaches while demonstrating advanced
optimization techniques for achieving optimal complexity bounds.
