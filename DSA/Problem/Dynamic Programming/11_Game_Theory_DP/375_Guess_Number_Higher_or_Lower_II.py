LeetCode 375: Guess Number Higher or Lower II
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Game Theory DP - Minimax Cost Optimization

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

1. I pick a number between 1 and n.
2. You guess a number.
3. If you guess the right number, you win the game.
4. If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess, and you have to continue guessing.
5. Every time you guess a wrong number x, you have to pay $x. If you guess the number, you don't have to pay anything.

What is the amount of money you need to guarantee that you can always find the number, regardless of which number I pick?

Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: The winning strategy is:
- 1st guess: 7, cost = 7
- If the number is 1-6, 2nd guess: 3, cost = 3
- If the number is 8-10, 2nd guess: 9, cost = 9
- Continue this strategy to guarantee finding the number.
The worst case cost is 16.

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 200

GUESS NUMBER HIGHER OR LOWER II - MINIMAX COST OPTIMIZATION:
============================================================

This problem demonstrates minimax optimization with cost considerations:
- Minimize worst-case cost rather than average case
- Strategic decision making balancing multiple risk scenarios
- Interval DP with cost-aware optimal substructure
- Decision tree construction for guaranteed performance bounds

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. **MINIMAX OPTIMIZATION**: Minimize the maximum cost across all possible scenarios
2. **COST-AWARE STRATEGY**: Guess value becomes the cost, affecting optimal choices
3. **WORST-CASE GUARANTEE**: Strategy must work regardless of which number is chosen
4. **INTERVAL DP**: Optimal substructure over contiguous number ranges
5. **STRATEGIC BALANCE**: Balance cost between left and right search subtrees

ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
====================

1. **Recursive**: O(n!) time, O(n) space
   - Pure recursive exploration without memoization
   - Exponential complexity due to overlapping subproblems

2. **Memoization**: O(nÂ³) time, O(nÂ²) space
   - Top-down DP with range-based state caching
   - Each (start, end) range computed once

3. **Bottom-up DP**: O(nÂ³) time, O(nÂ²) space
   - Iterative DP building from smaller to larger intervals
   - Most common approach for interval DP problems

4. **Strategy Reconstruction**: O(nÂ³) time, O(nÂ²) space
   - Include optimal decision tracking for strategy tree
   - Essential for understanding optimal play patterns

CORE MINIMAX COST ALGORITHM:
===========================
```python
def getMoneyAmount(n):
    # dp[i][j] = min cost to guarantee finding number in range [i,j]
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Fill for increasing interval lengths
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for start in range(1, n - length + 2):
            end = start + length - 1
            dp[start][end] = float('inf')
            
            # Try each possible guess in this range
            for guess in range(start, end + 1):
                left_cost = dp[start][guess - 1] if guess > start else 0
                right_cost = dp[guess + 1][end] if guess < end else 0
                
                # Worst case: pay guess + max of both subtrees
                worst_case = guess + max(left_cost, right_cost)
                dp[start][end] = min(dp[start][end], worst_case)
    
    return dp[1][n]
```

MINIMAX PRINCIPLE:
=================
**Worst-Case Optimization**: For each guess, consider the worst possible outcome
- If target is lower: pay guess + optimal cost for left range
- If target is higher: pay guess + optimal cost for right range
- Worst case: max of these two scenarios

**Strategic Implication**: Choose guess that minimizes maximum possible cost

COST-AWARE DECISION MAKING:
==========================
**Cost Function**: Wrong guess costs the guessed number
- Higher guesses are more expensive when wrong
- Lower guesses are cheaper but may lead to expensive subtrees
- Must balance immediate cost with future cost potential

**Strategic Trade-offs**:
- Conservative low guesses: cheap mistakes, potentially deep search
- Aggressive high guesses: expensive mistakes, potentially quick resolution
- Optimal strategy: mathematical balance of these factors

INTERVAL DP STRUCTURE:
=====================
**State Definition**: `dp[i][j]` = minimum cost to guarantee finding number in range [i,j]

**Transition**: For range [i,j], try each guess k âˆˆ [i,j]:
```
cost = k + max(dp[i][k-1], dp[k+1][j])
dp[i][j] = min over all k of cost
```

**Base Cases**: 
- `dp[i][i] = 0` (single number, no guessing needed)
- `dp[i][j] = 0` when i > j (empty range)

STRATEGY TREE CONSTRUCTION:
===========================
**Decision Tree**: Optimal strategy forms a binary decision tree
- Each node represents a guess for a range
- Left child: what to do if target is lower
- Right child: what to do if target is higher

**Tree Properties**:
- Depth varies based on worst-case path
- Each path guarantees finding target within cost bound
- Non-uniform branching based on cost optimization

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
===================
**Time Complexity**: O(nÂ³)
- nÂ² possible intervals [i,j]
- n possible guesses per interval
- Total: O(nÂ² Ã— n) = O(nÂ³)

**Space Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- DP table storage
- Strategy tracking (optional)

**Practical Performance**: Efficient for reasonable n (â‰¤ 200)

COMPARISON WITH BINARY SEARCH:
==============================
**Binary Search**: Always guess middle, optimizes comparison count
**Optimal Strategy**: Considers guess cost, may deviate from middle

**Trade-off Analysis**:
- Binary search: logâ‚‚(n) comparisons, variable cost per comparison
- Optimal strategy: potentially more comparisons, minimized total cost

APPLICATIONS:
============
- **Game Theory**: Optimal strategy under worst-case scenarios
- **Risk Management**: Minimizing maximum potential loss
- **Decision Trees**: Cost-aware optimal decision making
- **Search Algorithms**: Cost-sensitive search optimization
- **Competitive Programming**: Minimax problems with cost functions

RELATED PROBLEMS:
================
- **Binary Search Variations**: Different cost models
- **Minimax Games**: Two-player optimization
- **Interval DP**: Range-based optimization problems
- **Decision Theory**: Optimal choice under uncertainty

VARIANTS:
========
- **Fixed Cost per Guess**: Every wrong guess costs same amount
- **Bonus Systems**: Rewards for close guesses
- **Limited Guesses**: Maximum number of attempts allowed
- **Variable Ranges**: Different starting ranges

EDGE CASES:
==========
- **n = 1**: No guessing needed, cost = 0
- **n = 2**: Optimal to guess 1 first, cost = 1
- **Small Ranges**: Often optimal to guess conservatively
- **Large Ranges**: Complex balance between immediate and future costs

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
=======================
**Symmetry**: Leverage symmetric properties in strategy
**Pruning**: Early termination when cost bounds exceeded
**Memory Optimization**: Space-efficient DP implementation
**Strategy Caching**: Reuse computed optimal strategies

This problem demonstrates how cost considerations can
significantly alter optimal strategies compared to
traditional search algorithms, requiring sophisticated
analysis to balance immediate costs with future risks
in adversarial or worst-case scenarios.
