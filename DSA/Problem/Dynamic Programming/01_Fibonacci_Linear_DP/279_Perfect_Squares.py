LeetCode 279: Perfect Squares
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Fibonacci & Linear DP (Unbounded Knapsack variant)

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the 
product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 
3 and 11 are not.

Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
==================
This is an Unbounded Knapsack variant:
- Unlimited use of perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)
- Minimize number of perfect squares used
- Similar to Coin Change but with perfect squares as "coins"

KEY INSIGHTS:
============
1. Perfect squares are the "coins": 1Â², 2Â², 3Â², ..., âˆšnÂ²
2. We want minimum number of "coins" to make sum n
3. Each perfect square can be used unlimited times
4. This is exactly the Coin Change problem!

STATE DEFINITION:
================
dp[i] = minimum number of perfect squares that sum to i

RECURRENCE RELATION:
===================
dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - jÂ²] + 1) for all j where jÂ² â‰¤ i
Base case: dp[0] = 0

MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION:
=========================
Lagrange's Four Square Theorem: Every positive integer can be represented 
as sum of at most 4 perfect squares.

Legendre's Three Square Theorem: A positive integer can be represented as 
sum of 3 perfect squares iff it's not of the form 4áµƒ(8b + 7).

Algorithm:
1. If n is perfect square â†’ return 1
2. If n = aÂ² + bÂ² for some a,b â†’ return 2  
3. If n is of form 4áµƒ(8b + 7) â†’ return 4
4. Otherwise â†’ return 3

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
=======================
1. Precompute perfect squares up to âˆšn
2. BFS approach: find minimum steps to reach 0
3. Mathematical approach: O(âˆšn) using number theory
4. Early termination in DP when dp[i] = 1

VARIANTS TO PRACTICE:
====================
- Coin Change (322) - same pattern with different "coins"
- Coin Change 2 (518) - count ways instead of minimum coins
- Combination Sum IV (377) - count combinations
- Minimum Cost For Tickets (983) - similar optimization problem

INTERVIEW TIPS:
==============
1. Recognize as Coin Change variant with perfect squares
2. Show DP solution first: O(nâˆšn) time
3. Mention BFS as alternative approach
4. For advanced discussion: mathematical approach using number theory
5. Handle edge cases (n = 1, perfect squares)
6. Discuss space optimization possibilities
7. Compare with regular Coin Change problem
