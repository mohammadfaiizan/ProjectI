LeetCode 1025: Divisor Game
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Fibonacci & Linear DP / Game Theory

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
- Choosing any x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0.
- Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob is left with 1 and loses.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has 1 left and loses.
Or Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has 1 left and loses.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 1000

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
==================
This is a classic game theory DP problem:
- Two players with optimal play
- Game has perfect information
- Determine if first player (Alice) can win
- Mathematical pattern emerges: Alice wins âŸº n is even

KEY INSIGHT - MATHEMATICAL DISCOVERY:
====================================
Through DP analysis, we discover a simple pattern:
Alice wins if and only if n is even.

Mathematical Proof:
1. If n is even: Alice chooses x=1, leaving Bob with odd n-1
2. If n is odd: Any divisor x is odd, leaving Bob with even n-x
3. Player with even number can always force opponent to have odd
4. Game ends when someone gets n=1 (odd) and loses
5. Since Alice starts, she wins âŸº she can maintain even numbers

GAME THEORY CONCEPTS:
====================
1. **Perfect Information**: Both players see complete game state
2. **Zero-Sum Game**: One player wins, other loses
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play perfectly
4. **Backward Induction**: Analyze game tree from end states
5. **Winning/Losing Positions**: Classify game states

ALGORITHM PROGRESSION:
=====================
1. **Brute Force**: O(n!) - explore entire game tree
2. **Memoization**: O(nÂ²) - cache repeated game states  
3. **Tabulation**: O(nÂ²) - bottom-up DP computation
4. **Pattern Recognition**: O(1) - mathematical insight

The mathematical pattern makes DP unnecessary, but DP helps discover the pattern!

STATE DEFINITION:
================
dp[i] = True if current player can win starting with number i

RECURRENCE RELATION:
===================
dp[i] = True if there exists divisor x of i such that dp[i-x] = False
Base case: dp[1] = False (no valid moves)

MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES:
=======================
1. **Odd numbers**: All proper divisors are odd
2. **Even numbers**: Has divisor 1 (and possibly even divisors)
3. **Parity preservation**: odd - odd = even, even - odd = odd
4. **Control strategy**: Player with even n can force opponent to odd

VARIANTS TO PRACTICE:
====================
- Stone Game (877) - similar optimal play analysis
- Nim Game (292) - another pattern-based game
- Predict the Winner (486) - array-based game theory
- Stone Game II (1140) - more complex stone removal

INTERVIEW TIPS:
==============
1. Start with game theory DP approach
2. Implement memoization to handle overlapping states
3. Analyze small cases to find patterns
4. Prove mathematical pattern rigorously
5. Optimize to O(1) constant-time solution
6. Explain optimal strategies for both players
7. Discuss why pattern works (parity arguments)
8. Show game simulation for concrete examples
