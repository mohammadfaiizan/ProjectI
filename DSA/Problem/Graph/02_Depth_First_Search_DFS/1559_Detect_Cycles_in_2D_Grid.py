1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid
Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
Given a 2D array of characters grid of size m x n, you need to find if there exists any cycle 
consisting of the same value in grid.

A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. 
From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four 
directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the same value of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in the previous move. For example, 
the cycle (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) is not valid because from (1, 2) we visited (1, 1) 
which was the last visited cell.

Return true if any cycle is found, otherwise return false.

Examples:
Input: grid = [["a","a","a","a"],
               ["a","b","b","a"],
               ["a","b","b","a"],
               ["a","a","a","a"]]
Output: true

Input: grid = [["c","c","c","a"],
               ["c","d","c","c"],
               ["c","c","e","c"],
               ["f","c","c","c"]]
Output: true

Input: grid = [["a","b","b"],
               ["b","z","b"],
               ["b","b","a"]]
Output: false

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 500
- grid consists only of lowercase English letters

Graph Theory Concepts:
1. Cycle Detection in Undirected Graphs
2. Back Edge Detection
3. Parent Tracking in DFS
4. Graph Coloring (White-Gray-Black)

Key Cycle Detection Concepts:
- Back edge: Edge to an already visited node (not parent)
- Parent tracking: Avoid immediate backtrack in undirected graphs
- Color states: Track visiting state to detect back edges
- Union-Find: Detect cycle when connecting already connected components

Algorithm Variants:
- DFS with parent tracking: Most intuitive approach
- Color-based DFS: Classic graph algorithm technique
- Union-Find: Good for offline cycle detection
- Iterative DFS: Avoids recursion depth limits

Grid-Specific Considerations:
- 4-directional movement only
- Character matching constraint
- Minimum cycle length is 4
- Parent avoidance to prevent trivial cycles

Real-world Applications:
- Circuit design (electrical loops)
- Game level validation (path loops)
- Maze design (ensuring solvability)
- Network topology analysis
- Pattern recognition in images

This problem combines classic cycle detection with grid-specific constraints,
making it an excellent example of adapting graph algorithms to specific domains.
