310. Minimum Height Trees - Multiple Approaches
Difficulty: Medium

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you pick a node x as the root, the height of the tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path from x.

Return a list of all MHTs (minimum height trees) root candidates. If there are multiple MHTs, return all of them in any order.
