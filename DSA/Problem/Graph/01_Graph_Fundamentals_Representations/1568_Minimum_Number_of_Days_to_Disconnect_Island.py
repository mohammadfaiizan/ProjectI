1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island
Difficulty: Hard

Problem:
You are given an m x n binary grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of 1's.

The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island, otherwise is said disconnected.

In one day, we are allowed to change any single land cell (1) to a water cell (0).

Return the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid.

Examples:
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 2

Input: grid = [[1,1]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
- m, n <= 30
- grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

Graph Theory Concepts:
1. Island Connectivity Analysis
2. Articulation Points (Cut Vertices)
3. Graph Disconnection Problems
4. Connected Components

Key Insights:
1. Maximum answer is always 2 for connected islands with >2 cells
2. Answer is 0 if already disconnected
3. Answer is 1 if has articulation point or â¤2 cells
4. Articulation points are critical for connectivity

Mathematical Proof for Max = 2:
- Any connected island can be disconnected by removing at most 2 strategically chosen cells
- Corner cases: islands with 1-2 cells need fewer removals
- For larger islands: can always find 2 cells whose removal creates separation

Algorithm Complexity:
- Brute force: O((MN)Â²) - try each cell removal
- Optimized: Can use articulation point detection for O(MN)
- Practical: Given constraints (M,N â¤ 30), brute force is acceptable

Real-world Applications:
- Network vulnerability analysis
- Transportation route planning
- Circuit design and fault tolerance
- Social network disruption analysis
