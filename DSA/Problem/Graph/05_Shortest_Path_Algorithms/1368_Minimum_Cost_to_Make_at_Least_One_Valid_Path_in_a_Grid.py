1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid - Multiple Approaches
Difficulty: Medium

Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:

1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
3 which means go to the cell below. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
4 which means go to the cell above. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])

Notice that there could be some signs on the grid at the same position which points outside of the grid.

You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a grid cell, and your goal is to make the grid have at least one valid path from the upper left cell to the bottom-right cell.

Return the minimum number of times you need to change the sign on a grid cell to make the grid have at least one valid path.
